## Building Your First Teams App

This section details how to develop a Teams app by leveraging different capabilities such as a tab, scenario-based bot app, and message extension.

1. Identify the type of Teams app you wish to develop:

   - **Build a Basic Teams Tab App**: Kickoff your Teams app development journey with a simple tab app.
   - **Build a Scenario-Based Teams Bot App**: Develop a Teams app that perfectly fits a specific scenario or use-case, such as a notification bot suitable for delivering notifications, but not for chat functions.
   - **Build a Message Extension Teams App**: Create a search-oriented message extension Teams app.

2. Decide on the strategy to build your chosen app.
