# Optimizing Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams boasts a variety of apps, both internally developed as well as externally sourced, offering tabs, bots, and message extensions, or any combination thereof. These app capabilities can also be extended into Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, thereby amplifying the collaborative experience for users. 

Teams apps can either be personal or collective. The former facilitates one-on-one communication whereas the latter allows multiple users to simultaneously collaborate within the app.

They also serve as the hub where people come together to work. The clever positioning of an app aids in forming a cohesive business environment to cater to both internal and external needs.

* **Personalization with tabs and bots**

  Personal conversational bots in Teams provide a more open-ended feature, facilitating conversations between the bot and user. These bots can simplify complex information sets through dialogs (also known as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x).

  Consider a design tool app, a bot that sends notifications to all users increases user engagement. Furthermore, a chat bot can easily replace emails and phone calls for queries to IT or HR departments.

* **Surface existing apps**

  For existing web apps, SharePoint sites (or SPFx extensions), PowerApps, or other web-based applications, it could be beneficial to integrate it into Teams. This expands the user base and engagement for your apps.

* **Advantages of Teams Store**

  Introducing your app to the Teams Store not only improves app availability but also serves as a marketing prospect. For startups, Teams platform can help raise visibility of your products. The Teams Store marketplace presents a fantastic opportunity to increase your app's exposure to a wider audience.

* **Single Build, Multiple Platforms**

  Teams apps can be extended across the Microsoft 365 platform. This simplified mode of delivering cross-platform apps from a single codebase caters to an expanded user audience. Users donâ€™t need to exit their work context to use the app and administrators benefit from a consolidated management and deployment workflow.

  Utilize the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to enable your personal tab and message extension apps to work in other Microsoft 365 experiences, enhancing the reach of your app and optimizing your development and distribution processes.
